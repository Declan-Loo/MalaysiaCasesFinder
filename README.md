# MalaysiaCasesFinder

This project (done in Python) extracts data from the Ministry of Health (Malaysia)'s GitHub page which contains data about COVID-19 cases, vaccinations, clusters, etc.
URL: https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/

In this respository, I used the raw CSV that the repository provides for
- Daily Cases for a particular day and I did a graph using Seaborn to compare the difference between Daily Cases and Daily Recoveries for a day.

Update (28/08/2022)
Uploaded a simplified version to the original with the use of Data Science Libraries of Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn. I've been doing the Data Scientist With Python career track in DataCamp during the summer holidays. This version also includes a graph that compares Daily Cases/Recovered Cases, which is done with SeaBorn.

Screenshot of the graph as of 28/08/2022:
