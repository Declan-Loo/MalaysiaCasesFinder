# MalaysiaCasesFinder

This project (done in Python) extracts data from the Ministry of Health (Malaysia)'s GitHub page which contains data about COVID-19 cases, vaccinations, clusters, etc.
URL: https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/

In this respository, I used the raw CSV that the repository provides for
- Daily Cases for a particular day and I did a graph using Seaborn to compare the difference between Daily Cases and Daily Recoveries for a day.
